            Our mission here at Geonet is to connect the world. 
            To much of the news today is about separated we have become as a civilization. 
            So we built a new kind of social media. One based around the world. 
            To allow people to connect no matter where they are.

            Remember that a conversationsâ€™ progress.<br/>
            So talk to your neighbor, talk to a stranger<br/>
            Love a little harder, do someone a favor<br/>
            Be a little braver.
